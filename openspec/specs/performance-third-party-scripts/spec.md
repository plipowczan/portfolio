# performance-third-party-scripts Specification

## Purpose
TBD - created by archiving change seo-improvements. Update Purpose after archive.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Third-party tracking scripts load off the critical rendering path
Third-party tracking scripts (e.g. `clickrank.ai`) SHALL NOT be injected synchronously in `<head>`. They SHALL be deferred to after the browser signals idle or first interaction, using `requestIdleCallback` where supported with a `setTimeout(2000)` fallback.

#### Scenario: clickrank.ai loads after First Contentful Paint
- **WHEN** the homepage loads in a modern browser
- **THEN** the `clickrank.ai` script request occurs after the FCP event, not before

#### Scenario: Fallback triggers in browsers without requestIdleCallback
- **WHEN** the page loads in a browser that does not support `requestIdleCallback`
- **THEN** the `clickrank.ai` script is injected via `setTimeout(..., 2000)` (within 2-3 seconds of page load)

#### Scenario: Script still loads reliably
- **WHEN** a user stays on the page for more than 3 seconds in any supported browser
- **THEN** the `clickrank.ai` script has been injected and its network request has been issued
